# `phatsort-haskell` Design Log

## History

I listen to a number of podcasts, and every MP3 player that I have owned has
had firmware that does not sort the tracks in a directory.  The `fatsort`
utility worked on my first few MP3 players but did not work on later MP3
players.  The program would fail with an error, reporting that the filesystems
were inconsistent, but attempts to fix the filesystem would either fail or
cause the device to now work.

When I start listening to a new (to me) podcast, I first listen to the
episodes that have already been released.  I remove the episodes as I listen
to them, as well as add new episodes as they come out.  FAT entries for new
episodes are often stored in the locations of deleted old episodes, and I have
accidentally listened to new episodes out of order a number of times by
accident.  It is frustrating, so I decided to write my own utility to solve
the problem.

This utility was written quickly in order to solve my issue.  The code is not
particularly elegant; I wrote it in "hack mode," not "production mode."  Note
there there are no tests.  I am releasing it, however, because it might be of
use to others with the same problem.

## Name

Naming things is difficult, and I did not want to spend time on determining a
good name for this program.  I chose the first name that came to mind, as a
search does not find any existing software with the same name.

## Design Notes

This utility is completely in the `IO` monad.  If I (or anybody else) ever
decide to clean up the code, it needs to be rewritten to separate the IO from
the logic, perhaps using effects (freer monads) or tagless-final.
